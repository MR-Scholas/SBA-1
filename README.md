A website that displays an assortment of food items and asks the user to give their food preferences, as well as whether the user prefers sandwiches or dessert. Two additional pages accessible via the images on either side of the navigation bar display sandwiches or desserts, exclusively. The logo in the center of the navigation bar contains a dropdown menu with nonfunctional hyperlinks.
